To complete the TODOs in this program, the following steps need to be performed:

1 Download and process the dataset:
* This step involves downloading the dataset (if not already downloaded) and preprocessing it to extract the text data 
and other relevant information needed for training the language model. This may involve steps such as loading the raw data 
from a file, cleaning the text data to remove unwanted characters, and splitting the data into train, validation, and test sets.
2. Preprocess the text data:
* In this step, the text data needs to be preprocessed and prepared for training the language model. This may involve
steps such as tokenizing the text, converting the tokens to numerical indices, and padding the sequences to ensure that
all the input sequences have the same length.
3. Create the dataset and data generator:
* In this step, the preprocessed text data needs to be converted into a format that can be used by the language model
for training and evaluation. This may involve creating a tf.data.Dataset object and using it to create a data generator
that can be used to feed the data to the model in batches.
4. Train the language model:
* In this step, the language model is trained on the train data using the fit() method of the tf.keras.Model class.
The trained model can then be used to generate text.
5. Evaluate the language model on the test set:
* In this step, the trained language model is evaluated on the held-out test set to assess its performance.
This can be done using the evaluate() method of the tf.keras.Model class.
6. Fine-tune the language model for a specific task:
* In this step, the trained language model can be fine-tuned for a specific task, such as text generation or text
classification, by adding and training additional layers on top of the existing language model. This can be done using
the add() and fit() methods of the tf.keras.Model class.
