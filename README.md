# Artificial-General-Intelligence
This is an open-source artificial intelligence.
It is currently under development.
You should expect to see it completed by sometime in 2023.
For anyone who has seen Iron man, it's functionality will be quite similar to that of Just A Rather Very Intelligent System (J.A.R.V.I.S)
For those of you who use open ai, it will be similar to chatGpt, but this will be more capable of capable of understanding or learning any intellectual task that a human being can.
AGI is often seen as the next step in the evolution of AI, and it is expected to be able to solve problems and make decisions in a way that is similar to how humans do.
